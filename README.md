# dieVision

**dieVision** is an immersive web experience that brings exotic locations to life. A panoramic image wraps completely around the user‚Äôs viewpoint ‚Äî to see the full scene, users must physically rotate their device **360 degrees**, creating the illusion of actually standing at that place.

In addition, the app calculates the **distance between the user's current location** and the location shown in the panorama.

## Features

- üì∑ 360¬∞ panoramic navigation using the **DeviceOrientation API**
- üìç Real-time location access via the **Geolocation API**
- üìè Calculates distance from the user's current position to the scene
- üåê Runs entirely in the browser (HTML5 & JavaScript)

## Project Context
